This is a simple C++ program which is just a model of the existing billing system available in the medicine stores.
The medical store billing system helps the owner of the store in keeping the track of its customer .
In effect, a "pharmacy" is a store that sells drugs and various other products, and a "drugstore" is one that includes a pharmacy, and also sells other products.

Drugstores may sell cosmetics, toiletry items, first-aid supplies and patent medications, such as nonprescription cold medicines. Many drugstores sell greeting cards, gift cards and magazines. In addition, soft drinks, adult beverages, breakfast cereal and milk are common drugstore items.
